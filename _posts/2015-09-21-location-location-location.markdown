This is some sample text for a blog that I want to write. It's going to have a lot of cool shit.

Here is some example C code that does dumb shit:

{% highlight c %}
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");

    return 0;
}
#=> Prints "Hello, World!" to the console
{% endhighlight %}
