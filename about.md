Hi! My name is Federico Menozzi, and I study Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. During the day, I weave technological wonders in the dark of my room for no one to see. At night, I go back and fix all the bugs I made during the day. In my spare time, I like to learn about how computers work from the transistors up and make fun of web devs for doing what I never could.

If you'd like to learn mildly interesting things about computation, this is the blog for you.
