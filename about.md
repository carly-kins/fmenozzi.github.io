My name is Federico Menozzi, and I study Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. By night, I weave untold technological wonders in the dark of my room for no one to see. By day, I go back and fix the countless bugs in the resulting garbage. In my spare time, I like to learn about how computers work from the transistors up and make fun of web devs for doing what I never could.
